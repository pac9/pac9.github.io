# Background 
I've recently completed an intensive [full-time 19 week professional software development course](https://codeclan.com/courses/16-week-course/) at the digital skills and coding academy Codeclan in Edinburgh, UK. Course ended on 27th July 2018 after 3 weeks of pre-course work then 16 weeks in the classroom in Edinburgh. My class was collectively referred to as E21. 

More information on the course syllabus can be found  at https://pac9.github.io/codeclan_syllabus/

# Main projects

I contributed to 65 projects during the course, all of which can be found on my [github account](https://github.com/pac9). 

This page is a summary of week long projects undertaken and the skills learnt.

## Stock inventory system - CRUD Web Application

This project involved combining Ruby, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, HTML and CSS to create a stock inventory. 

The brief for the project can be found at https://pac9.github.io/sweet_shop/ with the project file at https://github.com/pac9/sweet_shop

This was a solo project built in Ruby using Sinatra and PostgresSQL to interact with the database. We were given one week to build this project with a presentation provided to the class at the end of the week. This project was undertaken in Week 5 for the course. 

During the making of the project I had to demonstrate that:
- the app had been built to fit the needs of the end user 
- ensure the online app could read, updated, and delete items in the database
- the principle of OOP and clean code were being practised
- test driven development was being undertaken 
- regular git commits were being made

## Fruit Machine(Slot Machine) - Native application

This project involved writing code in Java to create a fruit machine(slot machine). 

The brief for this project can be found at https://pac9.github.io/FruitMachineJavaProject/ with the project file at https://github.com/pac9/FruitMachineJavaProject

This was a solo project built in Java and run in the IntelliJ IDE.

We were given one week to build this project with a presentation provided to the class at the end of the week. This project was undertaken in Week 9 of the course.

I created two games through utilising an abstract class for the fruit machine and utilising enums for the content of the wheels. A runner file was used to pull together the code and run the game.  

During the making of the project I had to demonstrate that:
- test driven development was being undertaken 
- regular git commits were being made
- SOLID principles where being adhered to where relevant (in this case the single responsibility principle, open/closed principle and Liskov substitution principle were in point)
- consider the 4 pillars of OOP (here abstraction and encapsulation were used, polymorphism and inheritance were not)

## A full stack JavaScript web application

This project involved vanilla Javascript, Express, MongoDB and interacting with APIs.

This was a group project undertaken in Week 14 which lasted for a week at the end of which we gave a presentation to which all students and staff at Codeclan are invited.

The brief for this project can be found at https://pac9.github.io/Planet_Nine/ with the project file at https://github.com/pac9/Planet_Nine.  Although the brief indicated that the BBC should be considered as the user, the actual remit was less strict therefore we chose to create an educational app for use at a science festival or museum. Our vision was that our app would be shown on screens and tablets whereby the user would be drawn by visually stimulating images to explore and learn about our solar system and space through interacting with the app. 

Our app is designed to:
•	education you on the solar system, 
•	allows you to learn how the Hubble telescope is helping scientists understand how planets and galaxies form, 
•	be intrigued by the astronomy picture of the day, and 
•	provides insight into the location of and views from the international space station.

## Final Project - freedom of choice

The sketches are setup to run in the Processing development environment with the code written in Java.
